# PestNet: Hierarchical Scaled Dot-Product Attention for Insect Pest Detection

In this paper, we introduce PestNet, a novel one-stage object detector specifically designed for insect pest detection. Our method integrates two self-attention-based modules: SPA and HSDPA to enhance multi-scale feature representation and spatial awareness. We evaluate PestNet on two challenging benchmark datasets: IP102 and R2000. It consistently outperform existing methods in detection accuracy and robustness, with notable gains in mAP@50 and mAP@50:95 across diverse pest types and real-world complex conditions. PestNet achieves a favorable balance between model complexity and detection accuracy, making it practical for real-time applications in precision agriculture on GPU-based systems.
